# Introduction to Git and Github

See the [Glossary](docs/Glossary.md) first to get familliar with some of the terms
and concepts here.

Git and GitHub work together to provide a solution for developers to collaborate on
their work, keep track of their code, and maintain a portfolio of projects. The
difference between Git and GitHub can be confusing, since GitHub is closely tied
to Git.

GitHub is a website and application that makes using Git easier. Git is the 
[version control software](docs/Glossary.md) that is used behind the scenes of
GitHub to keep track of code. Git can be used without GitHub, but GitHub can only
be used with Git. There's other sites and applications that work with Git to do
similar things. GitHub is just one of the most popular ones, and is sort of like
a social network for software developers.

Git itself is complicated, so this just covers the basics. 

## Why Use Version Control at all?

Typically, when writing a document people periodically save what they are working.
If not, then you risk losing some of your work done since the last save should something
happen like a computer crash. But, just saving a file doesn't keep track of old versions
you might want to look at again. Online apps like Google Docs automatically save as
you go, backing it up in the cloud and keeping track of previous versions. A user can
always go back to a previous version of what they're working on, so this is an example
of simple version control. By keeping track of changes and previous versions of a
document, someone can see the history of how the document changed over time and reload
an old version if they like it better.

Software projects are much more complicated than one document, and can can have thousands
of different files with code for the project, with hundreds of developers changing
those files at the same time. Using version control helps coordinate all that work, so
developers can see the changes each other are making and maintain a history of how the
files have changed to reference if they need to. It's a more sophisticated system that's
similar to things like Google docs, where developers can download changes made by other
developers to work on together.

Even for personal projects, using version control is helpful if only to back up files
in case something would happen to lose them. It's also useful to upload projects to
sites like GitHub to create a portfolio of projects.
